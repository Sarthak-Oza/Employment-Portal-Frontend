Our intuitive dashboard enables employers to keep track of the candidates who have applied for their job postings, facilitating seamless communication and recruitment processes. 
Additionally, employers can access detailed candidate profiles to make informed hiring decisions.

**Job Portal** is built using cutting-edge technologies, including Node.js for the backend, and HTML/CSS along with Bootstrap for the frontend. 
MongoDB serves as our database solution, providing scalability and flexibility to handle large volumes of data effectively. We are committed to delivering a robust and reliable platform that meets the needs of both job seekers and employers.
